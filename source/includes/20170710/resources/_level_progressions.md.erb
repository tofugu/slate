# Level Progressions

Level progressions contain information about a user's progress through the WaniKani levels.

A level progression is created when a user has met the prerequisites for leveling up, which are:

* Reach a 90% passing rate on assignments for a user's current level with a `subject_type` of `kanji`. Passed assignments have `data.passed` equal to `true` and a `data.passed_at` that's in the past.
* Have access to the level. Under `/user`, the `data.level` must be less than or equal to `data.subscription.max_level_granted`.

## Level Progression Data Structure

> Example Structure

```json
{
  "id": 49392,
  "object": "level_progression",
  "url": "https://api.wanikani.com/v2/level_progressions/49392",
  "data_updated_at": "2017-03-30T11:31:20.438432Z",
  "data": {
    "created_at": "2017-03-30T08:21:51.439918Z",
    "level": 42,
    "unlocked_at": "2017-03-30T08:21:51.439918Z",
    "started_at": "2017-03-30T11:31:20.438432Z",
    "passed_at": null,
    "completed_at": null,
    "abandoned_at": null
  }
}
```

Attribute | Possible Values | Description
--------- | --------------- | -----------
`abandoned_at` | `null` or Date | Timestamp when the user abandons the level. This is primary used when the user initiates a [reset](#resets).
`completed_at` | `null` or Date | Timestamp when the user burns 100% of the assignments belonging to the associated subject's level.
`created_at` | Date | Timestamp when the level progression is created
`level` | Integer | The level of the progression, with possible values from `1` to `60`.
`passed_at` | `null` or Date | Timestamp when the user passes at least 90% of the assignments with a type of `kanji` belonging to the associated subject's level.
`started_at` | `null` or Date | Timestamp when the user starts their first lesson of a subject belonging to the level.
`unlocked_at` | `null` or Date | Timestamp when the user can access lessons and reviews for the `level`.

```

Returns a collection of all level progressions, ordered by ascending `created_at`, 500 at a time.

    "passed_at": null,
    "completed_at": null,
    "abandoned_at": null
  }
}
```

Retrieves a specific level progression by its `id`.

### HTTP Request

`GET <%= current_page.data.api_root_url %>/level_progressions/<id>`

### Parameters

Name | Data Type | Description
---- | ---------------- | -----------
`id` | Integer | Unique identifier of the level progression.


### Notes

The `unlocked_at`, `started_at`, `passed_at`, and `completed_at` timestamps are always in sequential order â€” level progressions can't be started before they're unlocked, passed before they're started, etc.
